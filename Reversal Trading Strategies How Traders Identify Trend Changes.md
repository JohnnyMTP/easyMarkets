# Reversal Trading Strategies: How Traders Identify Trend Changes 

Reversal trading strategies are designed to help traders recognise when a market trend may be coming to an end, and a new direction is beginning. These turning points can appear in any market (forex, shares, indices, or cryptocurrencies) and often present opportunities to enter trades earlier than trend-following approaches. 

This guide explores some of the most widely used reversal trading strategies, explains how traders typically define entries, stop losses, and targets, and shows how these techniques can be applied using modern trading platforms like [easyMarkets](https://www.easy-markets.com).

## What is reversal trading? 

Reversal trading focuses on identifying moments when an existing trend begins to weaken and potentially change direction. Instead of trading in line with the current move, reversal traders look for signs that momentum is fading, and that buyers or sellers may soon lose control. 

These strategies rely on a combination of: 
- Recognisable chart patterns 
- Momentum and trend indicators 
- Key price levels such as support and resistance 

The objective is not to predict every turning point, but to spot high-probability situations where the risk of trend continuation is increasing.

## Common Reversal Trading Strategies 

Below are several well-known approaches traders use to analyse and trade potential reversals. 

 

### 1) Head and Shoulders Pattern 

The Head and Shoulders pattern is one of the most recognisable reversal formations. It appears as three peaks: 

- A higher central peak (the head) 
- Two lower peaks on either side (the shoulders) 

An **inverse Head and Shoulders** follows the same structure but appears at the end of a downtrend. 

**Entry**
![Entry](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66022587-3ce5-4bbd-95b7-1480f492f34d)

- **Standard pattern:** Traders often look to enter after price breaks below the neckline.
- **Inverse pattern:** Entry is commonly considered when price breaks above the neckline.

**Stop Loss**
![Stop Loss](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ed8fed3-dd56-4e8e-b3fb-0ce8cc766949)

- **Standard pattern:** Above the right shoulder
- **Inverse pattern:** Below the right shoulder
These levels help limit losses if the expected reversal fails.

**Target**
![Target](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ab58257-a2c0-4ac1-972d-9ba4a6170d8c)

A common method is to measure the vertical distance from the head to the neckline and project that distance in the direction of the breakout.

### 2) Double Top and Double Bottom Strategy

Double Top and Double Bottom patterns signal potential trend exhaustion.

- A **Double Top** forms when price tests a high level twice and fails to break higher, often suggesting bearish pressure is building.
- A **Double Bottom** forms when price tests a low level twice and fails to break lower, hinting at growing buying interest.
  
**Entry**
![Entry](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91fc4ee1-aeaa-4f58-9a3f-216325f6f62c)

- **Double Top:** After price breaks below the low between the two peaks
- **Double Bottom:** After price breaks above the high between the two troughs

**Stop Loss**
![Stop Loss](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d30ff75-22b8-4c89-a5e6-28cd5c726b0a)

- **Double Top:** Above the second peak
- **Double Bottom:** Below the second trough
  
**Target**
![Target](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57b493a5-8062-4006-a2d4-4314929af90c)

Many traders project the height of the pattern from the breakout point to estimate a potential target.

### 3) Fibonacci Retracement Strategy

Fibonacci retracements are used to identify areas where price may pause or reverse during a pullback.

Common retracement levels include:

- 23.6%
- 38.2%
- 50%
- 61.8%
  
**Entry**
![Entry](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88a024b5-74a3-4370-90a8-4ba40911a3d5)

Traders often watch for price action or candlestick confirmation near these levels, especially when they align with support or resistance.

**Stop Loss**
![Stop Loss](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb17ce77-3716-46ee-b22b-823b1a731938)

Stops are frequently placed beyond the next Fibonacci level to allow room for normal market fluctuations.

**Target**
![Target](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1261bd8d-3d1c-4e1f-865d-f88507df8535)

Targets may be set using Fibonacci extension levels (such as 161.8% or 261.8%) or prior support and resistance zones.


### 4) RSI Divergence Strategy

**RSI divergence** occurs when price and the Relative Strength Index move in opposite directions, suggesting momentum is weakening.

- **Bullish divergence:** Price makes a lower low, RSI makes a higher low
- **Bearish divergence:** Price makes a higher high, RSI makes a lower high

**Entry**
![Entry](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac1f4a06-7e9a-4f6c-b1df-c27462bfc906)

Traders typically wait for additional confirmation, such as a break of structure or a candlestick signal, before entering.

**Stop Loss**
![Stop Loss](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b1d8bf1-e84e-46b3-8fec-9b385a4486a3)

Stops are usually placed beyond the most recent swing high or low.

**Target**
![Target](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7534ddb6-b76c-4848-bf73-f76ed1591490)

Previous support or resistance areas are often used, or a predefined risk-to-reward ratio is applied.

### 5) Moving Average Crossover Strategy

Moving average crossovers are used to identify shifts in trend direction.

- A **bullish crossover** occurs when a short-term moving average crosses above a longer-term one.
- A **bearish crossover** occurs when the short-term average crosses below the longer-term average.
  
**Entry**
![Entry](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0d30e5b-91e0-4ede-ae75-a3780610c97c)

- **Bullish:** After the short-term average crosses above the long-term average
- **Bearish:** After the short-term average crosses below the long-term average

**Stop Loss**
![Stop Loss](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81d2107a-e6cb-4fff-8ecf-92fe75c6413f)

- **Buy trades:** Below the most recent swing low
- **Sell trades:** Above the most recent swing high

**Target**
![Target](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80617c3e-787c-4f60-8eb2-dea07557b5a7)

Traders often use prior support and resistance levels or a fixed risk-to-reward ratio, such as 2:1.

## Conclusion

Reversal trading strategies aim to identify potential market turning points before a new trend fully develops. By understanding patterns such as Head and Shoulders, Double Tops and Bottoms, Fibonacci retracements, RSI divergence, and moving average crossovers, traders can improve their ability to assess when trends may be losing strength.

Like all trading approaches, reversal trading requires practice, patience, and disciplined risk management. Platforms such as [easyMarkets](https://www.easy-markets.com) provide tools, charting access, and risk controls that can help traders apply these strategies more confidently across different markets.
