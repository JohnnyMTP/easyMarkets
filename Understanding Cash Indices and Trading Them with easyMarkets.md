# What Are Cash Indices and How Can You Trade Them?

Have you come across the term “cash indices” but are not fully sure what it means or how trading them works? This article explains the concept in a clear and straightforward way, covering what cash indices are and how they can be traded.

## Defining Cash Indices

Cash indices are Contracts for Difference, also known as CFDs, that allow traders to speculate on the performance of major stock market indices without owning any shares. These instruments track the real-time prices of indices made up of leading global companies, such as the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq.

Trading a cash index means taking a position on the movement of the index as a whole. This allows traders to gain exposure to an entire market through a single position.

## How Cash Index Trading Works

When trading cash indices using CFDs, traders speculate on whether the price of an index will rise or fall. The underlying assets are not owned, and the trade is based only on price movement.

How it works:

-   Choose the cash index you want to trade, such as the US 500, Nasdaq 100, or DAX 40.
-   Enter the trade size.
-   Decide whether to go long (buy) or short (sell), depending on your market outlook.

Example:

Assume the US 500 is trading at 4000.

You expect Apple’s earnings to be weaker than expected, which could push the index lower, so you open a short position.

-   If the index rises to 4100, you close the trade with a 2.5 percent loss.
-   If the index falls to 3900, you close the trade with a 2.5 percent gain.

At no point do you own the index itself. The trade is based entirely on the difference between the opening and closing price.

## Reasons Traders Use Cash Indices

Trading cash indices offers several potential advantages:

-   Diversification: A single CFD position can provide exposure to hundreds of companies.
-   Liquidity: Major indices are widely traded, making it easier to enter and exit positions.
-   Lower volatility: Compared to individual stocks, indices tend to move more steadily.
-   No expiry: Unlike futures contracts, cash indices do not have an expiry date, allowing trades to be closed at any time.
-   Risk control: Because indices represent multiple companies, they are generally less affected by the performance of a single business.
