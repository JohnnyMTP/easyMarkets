# Using a Financial Calendar in Trading with easyMarkets


A financial calendar, often referred to as an economic calendar, is an important tool for traders. It outlines key events that can move markets, including interest rate decisions, employment figures, and inflation data. For anyone trading forex or other asset classes, understanding when these events are scheduled and how they may influence prices is essential for making informed trading decisions.

This article explains how to select a suitable financial calendar, which indicators are most relevant, and how calendar data can be applied to trading decisions.

## Step 1: Selecting a Financial Calendar

Instead of tracking political and economic events manually, many traders rely on online financial calendars that are updated regularly. These calendars bring together important events, forecasted results, and in some cases an indication of how significant each event may be for the market.

Tip: The [easyMarkets Financial Calendar](https://www.easy-markets.com/eu/financial-calendar/) displays upcoming events, forecast values, and their relevance to the market in one place.

When choosing a financial calendar, traders often look for one that:

- Provides real-time updates
- Clearly explains economic indicators
- Allows filtering by country, asset class, or level of importance

## Step 2: Identifying the Right Indicators

Not every economic release will matter to every trader or every asset. Traders typically focus on indicators that are most likely to affect their specific strategy or market. Commonly followed indicators include:

- Interest rate decisions
- Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP)
- Consumer Price Index (CPI)
- Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI)
- Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

Markets often form expectations ahead of these releases based on forecasts. Traders may position themselves before the data is published, depending on whether they expect the actual figure to be higher or lower than anticipated. Large surprises, particularly in widely followed indicators such as NFP, can lead to sharp market movements.

**For example:**

If the market expects 130,000 new jobs in an NFP release, an outcome that is significantly higher or lower than expected can cause a strong move in the USD, even if the result is still positive overall.

## Step 3: Using Calendar Data in Trading Decisions

When reviewing a financial calendar, traders often consider several questions:

- Which asset am I trading?
- Which countries and currencies are involved?
- Is the position short-term or long-term?

Different economic indicators can influence markets over different time horizons.

For example:

- **Intraday traders** may focus on short-term sentiment indicators such as PMI data or weekly jobless claims.
- **Long-term traders** may pay closer attention to broader developments like central bank policy decisions or GDP data.

It is also important to consider indirect relationships. Even if a trader is not directly trading a specific currency, events affecting that currency can still influence related markets. For instance, a significant decision by the Bank of Canada may impact the USD through changes in risk sentiment or commodity-linked movements.

## Considering the broader context

While an economic calendar is a valuable planning tool, it does not predict outcomes. Traders should always take into account the wider political and economic environment. Unexpected geopolitical events, central bank statements, or shifts in global market sentiment can strengthen or weaken the impact of scheduled data releases.

The aim is not simply to react to news as it happens, but to consider possible scenarios in advance and manage risk accordingly.

### Final thoughts

A financial calendar helps traders to:

- Stay informed about important market events
- Anticipate potential price movements
- Improve risk management through better timing

Even when traders choose not to trade an event directly, knowing when it takes place allows them to adjust their strategy or avoid periods of high volatility. Effective use of a financial calendar involves planning ahead and protecting trades, not just watching for headlines.
