# A Beginner's Guide to Reading Trading Charts

Trading charts are essential tools for analysing market behaviour. They show how prices move over time, helping traders identify trends, monitor volatility, and make informed decisions. On the [easyMarkets platform](https://www.easymarkets.com/eu/platforms/easymarkets/), a variety of chart types and built-in analysis tools support smarter trading across any timeframe.

## Getting Started: Choosing a Chart Type

After logging into the easyMarkets platform, traders can click the chart icon (shaped like a candlestick) to open the chart view. From there, they can select from several chart styles, each offering a different way to visualise price data:

- Bars (OHLC)
- Candlesticks
- Hollow Candlesticks
- Heikin Ashi
- Line
- Area
- Baseline

The right-hand side (Y-axis) displays price levels, while the bottom (X-axis) shows the timeline. These charts are responsive across different timeframes, enabling everything from minute-by-minute tracking to long-term trend analysis.

## Chart Types Explained

### Bar Charts

Bar charts show the **open, high, low, and close** for each trading session. Taller bars indicate greater volatility, while the direction of price movement is visible through colour.

![Bar Charts](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e6f33f8-f44c-4287-acc2-d36fcaa77f48)

For example:
- **Green bar**: Closed higher than it opened (bullish)
- **Red bar**: Closed lower than it opened (bearish)

This type of chart is useful for assessing price momentum and pressure.

### Candlestick Charts

Candlestick charts provide visual clarity by showing the open and close prices as a "body," and highs and lows as wicks or shadows.

![Candlestick Charts](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d741736d-c690-4ae0-b09c-5ebc49f71f3d)

- **Green candle**: Bullish session
- **Red candle**: Bearish session

Common candlestick patterns, such as dojis, hammers, or engulfing candles, may help anticipate potential reversals or trend continuations.

### Hollow Candlesticks

Hollow Candlesticks charts compare current price action with the previous day's performance.

![Hollow Candlesticks](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95c38e9c-e846-4ec7-8eb9-cfc9cf300fb1)

Here's how to read them:
- **Solid green**: Closed higher than the previous close, but lower than the open
- **Hollow green**: Closed higher than both the open and the previous close
- **Hollow red**: Closed lower than the previous close, but higher than the open
- **Solid red**: Closed lower than both the open and the previous close

These charts assist in understanding short-term price sentiment.

### Heikin Ashi

Heikin Ashi charts use averaged price data to smooth out volatility and highlight overarching trends. While they don't show exact open and close levels, they are effective for filtering out noise and keeping attention on the broader market trend.

### Line Charts

Line charts connect closing prices across sessions, creating a simple visual representation of price movement. This format is ideal for traders seeking a clean, high-level view without excess detail.

## Key Features of Trading Charts

### Adjusting Timeframes

Traders can choose timeframes based on their strategy:
- 1-minute, 5-minute, 15-minute
- Hourly, daily, weekly, monthly

Shorter timeframes suit active trading and intraday movements, while longer periods support broader market analysis.

### Using Technical Indicators

By clicking the 'Indicators' tab, traders gain access to a range of tools that enhance technical analysis:

- **Moving Averages**: Smooth price data to reveal trend direction
- **Bollinger BandsÂ®**: Identify overbought or oversold conditions
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Gauge market momentum
- **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**: Spot momentum shifts and possible trend reversals

These indicators can be applied individually or layered for a more detailed strategy.

### Comparing Instruments on One Chart

With the 'Compare' tool, traders can overlay multiple instruments on the same chart. For example, comparing gold (XAU/USD) and EUR/USD can reveal market correlations or how assets react to similar events.
