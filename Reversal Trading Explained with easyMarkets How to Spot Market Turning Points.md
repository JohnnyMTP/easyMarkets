# Reversal Trading Explained with easyMarkets: How to Spot Market Turning Points  

Reversal trading focuses on one of the most interesting moments in any market: the point where a trend loses momentum and starts to move the other way. Whether it’s a currency pair, a share, or a commodity, spotting a potential shift early can help traders plan better entries, manage exits more effectively, and avoid holding positions as momentum fades.  

This guide explains what reversal trading is, how reversals are commonly identified, which indicators are most frequently used, and what risks traders should keep in mind. Platforms such as easyMarkets can support this style of trading by providing charting access, risk-management tools, and clear trade execution across multiple markets.

## What is reversal trading?  

Reversal trading is a strategy built around identifying moments when a market may be transitioning from:  

- **Bullish to bearish** (an uptrend turning down)  
- **Bearish to bullish** (a downtrend turning up)  

Rather than following the existing trend, reversal traders look for signs that the current move is weakening and a new direction may be forming. Because this approach often goes against the prevailing sentiment, it typically requires:  

- Confidence in technical analysis  
- A clear, rules-based plan  
- Patience to wait for confirmation  
- Discipline to cut losses when a reversal fails  

A key point: a reversal is not the same as a brief pullback. Reversal traders aim to catch a *change in trend*, not a short-term dip inside the existing trend.

## How traders spot reversals  

Reversals rarely appear with one perfect signal. More often, traders build confidence by combining multiple clues: price behaviour, momentum, volume, and key levels.  

### 1) Momentum shifts with indicators  

Momentum tools help traders judge whether the trend still has strength behind it.  

- **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** often used to flag overbought (>70) and oversold (<30) conditions  
- **MACD:** looks for momentum shifts through crossovers of the MACD line and signal line.  
- **Stochastic Oscillator:** helps detect short-term momentum swings near support and resistance  

### 2) Candlestick reversal patterns  

Candlesticks can reflect changing control between buyers and sellers. Common patterns reversal traders watch include:  

- **Doji:** indecision that can appear near turning points  
- **Hammer / Inverted Hammer:** often seen when selling pressure starts to fade  
- **Engulfing patterns:** may signal a stronger shift in sentiment when one candle fully ‘overruns’ the previous one  

### 3) Key levels and price structure  

Reversals often form around areas where traders are already watching closely:  

- Long-term **support** and **resistance**  
- Previous swing highs/lows  
- Range boundaries  
- Widely used levels such as **Fibonacci retracements**  

A break and hold above resistance (or below support), especially with strong participation, can be a meaningful clue.  

### 4) Volume confirmation  

Volume is often used as a ‘reality check’:  

- A reversal supported by **rising volume** is often taken more seriously  
- A reversal attempt on **thin volume** may be less reliable and more prone to failure  

### 5) Divergence  

Divergence appears when price and an indicator disagree, which often a warning that momentum is fading.  

- **Bullish divergence:** price makes a lower low, indicator makes a higher low  
- **Bearish divergence:** price makes a higher high, indicator makes a lower high  

Divergence does not guarantee a reversal, but it often encourages traders to look for confirmation through levels and patterns.

## Best indicators for reversal trading  

Below are three widely used tools that many traders combine for reversal analysis.  

### Relative Strength Index (RSI)  

RSI helps traders gauge momentum and potential exhaustion.  

Common interpretation:  

- **Above 70:** market may be stretched to the upside (possible reversal risk)  
- **Below 30:** market may be stretched to the downside (possible rebound risk)  

RSI becomes more useful when paired with:  

- Divergence (RSI rising while price falls, or vice versa)  
- Candlestick confirmation near a key level  

### MACD  

MACD focuses on momentum and trend shifts.  

Typical reversal signals include:  

- **Bullish:** MACD line crosses above the signal line  
- **Bearish:** MACD line crosses below the signal line  

Many traders also watch the **histogram:**  

Expanding bars can suggest strengthening momentum in the new direction  

Shrinking bars can suggest the old trend is losing force  

### Stochastic Oscillator  

The **Stochastic Oscillator** is a momentum-based indicator commonly used in reversal trading to highlight when a market may be **overbought** or **oversold**.  

To apply it properly, traders often begin with the **standard default settings: 14, 3, 3** for **%K, Slow %K**, and **%D**. In simple terms:  

- **%K** is the raw Stochastic reading, showing where the current price sits compared with the **high-low range** over a chosen lookback period (usually **14 period**s).  
- **Slow %K** smooths %K by applying a **simple moving average** (typically **3 periods**) to reduce noise and make signals easier to interpret.  
- **%D** is a moving average of Slow %K (also commonly **3 periods**) and acts as the **signal line** traders monitor for crossovers.  

After it is set up, traders generally watch for two classic reversal cues:  

- A **bullish reversal** may be signalled when **%K crosses above %D** while the indicator is in **oversold territory (below 20)**, hinting at a potential buying opportunity.  
- A **bearish reversal** may appear when **%K crosses below %D** in **overbought territory (above 80)**, suggesting a possible sell setup.  

The Stochastic Oscillator tends to be most useful in **range-bound markets**, where price frequently oscillates between **support and resistance**, rather than in strong, one-directional trends.

## When reversal trading tends to work best  

Reversal trading is most commonly applied when markets show signs of exhaustion or structural change, such as:  

- A long trend that begins to stall or produce divergence  
- A market that has moved into a tight range and then breaks out with reversal signals  
- Major news or economic events that trigger sharp repricing  
- Price reaching a long-term technical boundary (support/resistance zones, multi-month levels)  

It is usually more challenging when a trend is exceptionally strong and supported by major fundamentals, as ‘false reversals’ can appear repeatedly.  

--- 

## Example of a reversal in trading  

A common real-world reversal setup occurs when price sells off aggressively into a well-watched support area and then starts to show signs of seller exhaustion.  

For example, a market might:  

- Form a **double bottom** near a key support zone  
- Show **bullish divergence** on MACD or RSI  
- Print a reversal candlestick pattern (such as a hammer)  
- Attract **stronger volume** as buyers step in  

When several of these signals align, traders often describe it as ‘confluence’, or multiple independent hints pointing toward a potential turning point.

## Advantages of reversal trading  

When executed with discipline, reversal trading can offer:  

- **Earlier entries into new trends** compared to chasing moves mid-stream  
- **Strong risk-to-reward potential**, especially if entry is near a clearly defined level  
- **Clear structure for trade planning**, because invalidation points (where the setup is wrong) can be obvious  
- **Skill-building benefits**, as it encourages deeper technical understanding and patience  

---

## Disadvantages of reversal trading  

Reversal trading is also demanding, and it comes with well-known challenges:  

- **False signals:** many ‘reversals’ are only pullbacks before the trend continues  
- **Psychological pressure:** entering against the crowd can feel uncomfortable  
- **Timing risk:** too early can mean taking unnecessary losses; too late can mean missing the move  
- **Monitoring needs:** reversals can develop quickly, especially around news or high volatility

## Key takeaways  

Reversal trading can be a valuable addition to a trader’s toolkit, particularly for those who enjoy technical analysis and prefer structured setups. By combining indicators like **RSI, MACD**, and the **Stochastic Oscillator** with price action, candlestick patterns, and volume confirmation, traders can improve their ability to identify potential market turning points.  

The strategy still requires caution: reversals fail often, and disciplined risk management matters as much as the entry signal. With the right preparation, and supportive tools available on platforms such as [easyMarkets](https://www.easy-markets.com), traders can approach reversal setups with more clarity and control.

## Frequently Asked Questions  

### What assets are commonly used for reversal trading?  

Reversal trading can be applied to shares, forex, commodities, indices, and cryptocurrencies. Many traders prefer liquid markets because signals and execution are often cleaner.  

### Does reversal trading work in every market condition?  

Not always. It can be difficult in strong, fundamental-driven trends where price keeps pushing in one direction despite ‘overbought/oversold’ signals.  

### What are the biggest psychological hurdles?  

Traders often struggle with entering against the trend, waiting for confirmation, and accepting that reversal strategies may produce more failed trades than trend-following approaches.  

### How does leverage affect reversal trading?  

Leverage can amplify gains, but it also increases the cost of being early (or wrong). Many traders reduce position size when using leverage and rely on strict stop-loss rules.  

### What risk management techniques are commonly used?  

Reversal traders often use:  

- Strict stop-loss levels beyond key highs/lows  
- Position sizing to limit damage from failed setups  
- Trailing stops once the new trend begins to move in their favour  
- Avoiding overexposure around major news events
