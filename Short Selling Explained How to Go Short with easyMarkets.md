# Short Selling Explained: How to Go Short with easyMarkets

Short selling (or ‘going short’) is a strategy traders use when they believe an asset’s price is about to fall. Rather than buying low and selling high, short sellers aim to sell high and buy back lower. While it may sound complex, the mechanics are straightforward, especially when using derivatives like CFDs.

Explore how short selling works, see real examples in action, understand the key pros and cons, and learn how to trade short on the easyMarkets platform.

## How Short Selling Works

### Conventional Approach with Borrowing

When shorting traditional assets (like stocks), the typical process is:

1. Borrow shares from a broker  
2. Sell those borrowed shares immediately  
3. Later, buy back the shares at a lower price  
4. Return the shares to the broker  
5. Keep the difference as profit (or absorb the loss if the price moved up)

If the price falls as predicted, the trader gains; if it rises, the trader incurs a loss.

### Using CFDs to Simplify the Process

With **Contracts for Difference (CFDs)**, traders can short an asset without owning or borrowing it. CFD platforms allow selling the asset synthetically by opening a sell position. The difference between entry and exit determines profit or loss.

This method is popular because it removes logistical challenges like borrowing shares and simplifies execution.

## A CFD Sell Position Examples

**A profitable example:**

- Asset: Ford shares at $14  
- Trader opens a short CFD position on 100 shares  
- Price drops to $13.30  
- Profit = ($14 - $13.30) × 100 = **$70**

**A losing example:**

- Asset: Coca-Cola shares at $55  
- Trader shorts 100 shares via CFD  
- Price rises to $56.10  
- Loss = ($56.10 - $55) × 100 = **–$110**

These examples illustrate how profits and losses in short selling are symmetric in concept but opposite in direction.

## Pros & Cons of CFD Short Selling

### Advantages

- Profit from falling markets: Traders can benefit even when prices decline.  
- No need to own the asset: Short selling via CFDs bypasses ownership and borrowing.  
- Use of leverage: Positions can be amplified (with added risk).  
- Hedging tool: It can act as protection against downside risk in a portfolio.

### Disadvantages

- Unlimited loss potential: Losses can exceed the initial margin if prices rise sharply.  
- Overnight fees / swaps: Holding short positions overnight can incur costs.  
- Margin calls: Sudden price spikes may trigger margin requirements.
