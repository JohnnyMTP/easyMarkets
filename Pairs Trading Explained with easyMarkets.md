# Pairs Trading Explained with easyMarkets

Pairs Trading is a popular market-neutral approach built around the idea that two related assets tend to move together over time. When their prices drift apart temporarily, traders attempt to capitalise on the imbalance by buying the weaker asset and selling the stronger one. Although the concept began in institutional trading circles during the 1980s, advances in online platforms and data accessibility have made the strategy far more attainable for everyday traders.

This guide provides a clear overview of how Pairs Trading works, where it can be applied, and what tools traders use to implement it successfully. Platforms like easyMarkets make the strategy even more accessible by offering transparent trading conditions and a wide range of correlated markets.

## What is Pairs Trading?

At its core, Pairs Trading is a type of statistical arbitrage. Instead of focusing on the direction of the overall market, the strategy examines the relationship between two assets that typically behave similarly. When these assets diverge from their usual pattern, traders position themselves for an eventual return to balance.

In practice, this means:

- Going long on the lagging instrument  
- Going short on the outperforming one  
- Closing both trades when their price relationship normalises  

Because the strategy is rooted in mean reversion, it can be applied whether markets are trending or moving sideways.

## How the strategy works

Pairs Trading generally follows a simple but disciplined process:

1. **Choose a pair**  
   Select two assets with a well-established historical correlation — often from the same industry, sector, or category.

2. **Monitor the spread**  
   Track how far their price relationship deviates from the average. Traders often use ratios, moving averages, or z-scores for this.

3. **Wait for a divergence**  
   A meaningful separation in price behaviour may signal a temporary misalignment.

4. **Open the trade**  
   - Buy the asset that appears undervalued  
   - Sell the asset that appears overvalued  

5. **Close the trade on convergence**  
   Once the spread returns to typical levels, the position is exited.

**This method doesn’t rely on predicting market direction, only on the relationship between the two assets rebalancing.**

## Example scenario: Apple and Microsoft

Consider two large technology companies: Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Historically, their stock prices often show similar trends because both operate in comparable industries and are influenced by similar market forces.

If Apple jumps sharply after a product announcement while Microsoft remains steady, the price gap between them may widen. A Pairs Trader might:

- Short Apple, expecting its surge to cool  
- Go long Microsoft, anticipating that it may catch up or benefit from broader tech-sector momentum  

If the two prices drift back toward their usual relationship, the trade can yield a profit, even if the broader stock market moves unpredictably during that period.

## Pairs Trading across different markets

Pairs Trading is versatile and can be adapted to nearly any market where correlations exist.

### Cryptocurrency

Digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum occasionally move in tandem, driven by shared sentiment, macro trends, and liquidity conditions. However, crypto correlations can shift quickly due to news, regulatory developments, or social media influence. Because volatility is high, traders often use tighter risk controls when applying Pairs Trading to crypto markets.

### Stocks

In equity markets, traders often pair companies within the same sector, such as Visa and Mastercard or Ford and General Motors. These businesses tend to respond similarly to economic data, consumer behaviour, and industry trends. Stock pairs benefit from ample historical pricing data and clear fundamental relationships.

**Commonly Observed Stock Pairs**

- Coca-Cola (KO) / PepsiCo (PEP)  
- Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A) / BP (BP)  
- Walmart (WMT) / Costco (COST)  
- Visa (V) / Mastercard (MA)  
- Exxon Mobil (XOM) / Chevron (CVX)  
- Ford (F) / General Motors (GM)  

These examples provide a starting point, but traders should always confirm current correlation strength before acting.

### Forex

Currency markets are naturally suited to Pairs Trading due to high liquidity and steady, data-driven movements. Popular combinations include:

- **EUR/USD** and **GBP/USD**  
- **USD/JPY** and **AUD/USD**  

Traders usually select major pairs with strong historical relationships and watch for divergences created by economic news, interest-rate shifts, or risk sentiment changes.

### CFDs (Contracts for Difference)

CFDs allow traders to apply Pairs Trading across multiple asset classes, including commodities, indices, equities, and more. The ability to take both long and short positions makes CFDs convenient for executing market-neutral strategies. However, because CFDs often involve leverage, risk management becomes even more important.

## Benefits of Pairs Trading

- **Market neutrality:** Potential to profit regardless of whether markets rise or fall.  
- **Reduced exposure to broad market swings:** Long and short positions offset each other.  
- **Useful in volatile conditions:** Divergence opportunities may appear more frequently.  
- **Cross-asset flexibility:** Works in equities, currencies, crypto, commodities, and CFDs.  
- **Additional diversification:** Complements directional strategies.  

---

## Risks and Limitations

- **Correlation breakdown:** Assets that once tracked closely may decouple permanently.  
- **Fundamental shifts:** Earnings reports, management changes, or macro events can alter price behaviour.  
- **Slow mean reversion:** Spreads may widen before converging.  
- **Statistical complexity:** Requires reliable data and disciplined execution.  
- **Trading costs:** Frequent trades can increase fees and reduce net profit.  

Effective Pairs Traders regularly reassess their selected pairs and stay alert for signs that traditional relationships are weakening.

## Measuring Correlation

To identify viable trading pairs, traders use statistical tools like the **Pearson correlation coefficient**, which measures the linear relationship between two assets:

- **+1.0:** Perfect positive correlation  
- **0.0:** No correlation  
- **-1.0:** Perfect inverse correlation  

For Pairs Trading, correlations close to +1.0 are typically preferred. However, traders also consider co-integration and z-score analysis to improve timing and confirm the quality of the pair.

## Helpful Tools for Pairs Traders

- **Moving averages:** Track long-term and short-term spread behaviour.  
- **Z-score indicators:** Identify meaningful deviations from the norm.  
- **Correlation matrices:** Visualise relationships between multiple assets.  
- **Charting platforms:** Tools such as TradingView or MetaTrader help compare price movements and create spread charts.  

Many trading platforms, including easyMarkets, offer a broad selection of correlated assets and transparent conditions that make it easier to analyse and execute relative-value strategies.

## In Conclusion

Pairs Trading stands out as a flexible and market-neutral approach that can perform well in a wide range of conditions. It focuses on relationships, not direction, making it especially useful when markets feel choppy or unpredictable. While the strategy demands careful analysis, patience, and reliable data, it offers a structured way to pursue steady, risk-adjusted returns.

## FAQs

**Is Pairs Trading suitable for beginners?**  
Yes, provided beginners take time to understand statistical concepts, practice patience, and learn proper risk management.

**Is Pairs Trading a form of arbitrage?**  
It is often categorised as statistical arbitrage, since profits arise from correcting temporary mispricing between related assets.

**Are there different kinds of Pairs Trading strategies?**  
Yes. Some traders focus on statistical methods, while others prefer relative-value analysis or sector-based approaches.

**How do I choose the right pair?**  
Look for assets with strong historical correlation, similar market drivers, and sufficient liquidity. Confirm that the price spread tends to revert over time.

**Can Pairs Trading work in volatile markets?**
