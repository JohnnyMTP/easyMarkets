# How to Use Leverage in Trading: A Guide with easyMarkets

![What is Leverage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e68b65d7-3685-4939-bb6c-c7e5b7b1c6d9)

In forex and CFD trading, price movements are typically small, especially for major currency pairs like EUR/USD, which may move just 100 to 150 pips a day. To make the most of these modest shifts, traders often turn to leverage, a tool that magnifies both potential gains and losses.

This guide breaks down how leverage works, why it's used, and how it can be managed responsibly with tools available through regulated brokers like easyMarkets.

## What is leverage?


[![video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df425067-d522-4935-97c8-54000558f86b)](https://vimeo.com/837812113)

Leverage allows traders to control a larger position than the capital they commit. It is expressed as a ratio (e.g., 1:50, 1:100), indicating how much more exposure a trader has compared to their own invested margin (the amount of capital the trader must commit to open a leveraged position).

**Example:**

A trader with $1,000 and 1:100 leverage can control a $100,000 trade.  
If EUR/USD moves 100 pips in their favor, the trader could earn $1,000 (vs. just $10 without leverage).  
However, the same leverage would amplify losses if the market moves against the trader.  

Think of leverage like borrowing capital to increase your buying power in the market. Once a trade is closed, the borrowed portion is returned, and the trader keeps the profit or absorbs the loss.

## The double-edged nature of leverage

While leverage can significantly boost returns, it also increases risk. A small adverse movement in the market could trigger a stop loss or margin call much faster when using higher leverage. This is why responsible traders:

- Start with lower leverage when learning  
- Use defined stop losses  
- Understand position sizing  
- Monitor risk-to-reward ratios consistently  

Proper risk management is crucial when trading with leverage.

easyMarkets offers flexible leverage across a wide range of instruments on its proprietary web platform, mobile app, and other supported platforms. Leverage limits vary depending on the trader’s region, regulation, and the specific asset class.

What sets easyMarkets apart is the combination of **leverage** with [integrated *risk-management tools*](https://www.easy-markets.com/eu/trading-conditions/), including:

**Guaranteed Stop Loss with No Slippage**  
Ensures that trades close at the exact stop level, regardless of volatility.

**Negative Balance Protection**  
Prevents clients from losing more than their deposited funds.

These features are especially valuable when trading with leverage during fast-moving or uncertain markets.

## Types of trades supported with leverage

Leverage on easyMarkets can be applied to:

- **Day trades**  
- **Pending orders**  
- **Vanilla Options**  

When placing a trade, traders select the total position size (margin + leverage). The platform automatically calculates the risk-to-stop distance. The greater the risk exposure selected, the closer the stop-loss will be to the market price – ensuring potential losses are capped based on the trader’s preference.

> *Leverage levels may vary by region and instrument. For full details, refer to the easyMarkets Spreads and Trading Conditions.  
> **Guaranteed Stop Loss with No Slippage is only available on the easyMarkets web and app platforms and can be activated with wider spreads for total risk control.
