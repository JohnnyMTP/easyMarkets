# A guide to the central banks that move markets with easyMarkets

## Why are Central Banks Important

Central banks play an important role in shaping both national economies and global financial markets. Through decisions related to monetary policy, they influence interest rates, inflation levels, currency strength, and overall financial stability.

For traders, understanding how central banks operate is essential. A single policy announcement or statement from a major central bank can trigger sharp movements across currency, commodity, and index markets.

A stable economic environment supports business expansion and long-term growth. This is especially relevant in international trade and investment, where foreign exchange risk can significantly affect returns and profitability.

## Central banks and Risk Management

Risk management is closely connected to central bank activity, as changes in interest rates or inflation policy can alter market conditions and trading dynamics.

As a result, traders often pay close attention to:

-   Stop loss placement
-   Position sizing
-   Risk-to-reward ratios
-   Fees, such as spreads and transaction costs

These elements can directly influence win rates and overall account performance.

## Which Central Banks are Shaping the Markets?

Several central banks have a particularly strong influence on global financial markets. Three that traders should monitor are outlined below:

### The Federal Reserve (The Fed)

The Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States. It was established in 1913 with the aim of creating a more stable and secure financial system. The institution is responsible for setting U.S. monetary policy and supervising the country’s largest banking institutions.

The Federal Reserve is governed by the **Board of Governors**, led by **Jerome Powell** at the time of writing. It also includes the **Federal Open Market Committee**, or FOMC, which plays a key role in interest rate decisions. Announcements from the Fed are among the most closely watched events in global markets, particularly by forex and CFD traders.

### The European Central Bank (ECB)

The **European Central Bank** was founded in 1998 and is headquartered in Frankfurt. It manages the euro and is responsible for maintaining price stability across the Eurozone.

The ECB sets monetary policy for the 20 European Union countries that use the euro. It is led by its President, **Christine Lagarde**, who chairs the Executive Board. Traders follow ECB decisions closely for signals about the strength of the European economy and possible movements in the euro.

### The Bank of England (BoE)

The **Bank of England** is the United Kingdom’s central bank and dates back to 1694. It became fully nationalised in 1946 and was granted authority to set interest rates in 1998.

The BoE plays a central role in managing the UK’s monetary policy, inflation targets, and financial stability. As of 2025, the Governor of the Bank of England is Andrew Bailey. Reports and statements from the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) can have a significant impact on the British pound and UK-focused indices.

## What is the Ongoing Role of Central Banks?

Since the global financial crisis of 2008, central banks have taken a more active role in supporting economic growth. Policy tools such as quantitative easing and forward guidance have become widely used.

By increasing liquidity and shaping market expectations, central banks aim to encourage confidence and support sustained economic activity. As a result, traders should closely monitor press releases, policy updates, and economic forecasts from these institutions. Even subtle changes in wording or tone can influence market direction.

Some traders use tools such as the [easyMarkets Financial Calendar](https://www.easy-markets.com/eu/financial-calendar/) to follow upcoming central bank decisions and stay informed about scheduled policy announcements.
